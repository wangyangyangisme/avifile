AVI tools

The Avifile package (http://divx.euro.ru/) provides a library of
primitives for reading/parsing .AVI (Windows Media Player) video
files.  There are a few obvious things (like displaying file info and
concatenating files) that I wanted to do and which are pretty easy to
do using this library.  Hence this package...


There are currently 3 programs:

avitype - For a set of .avi files, print a little display for each
	  with the video/audio codecs, frame size, frame rate, etc.
	  This display is not currently very clean or well organized.
	  Somebody could enhance this quite a bit.

avicat  - Take a set of .avi files and combine them into one single
	  .avi file.  Specify output with a -o option or else
	  "out.avi".  Assumes inputs are same format, otherwise bad
	  things might happen...

avimake - Take a set of .jpg images and turn them into a div3 movie.
	  Output specified with -o, frame rate with -r.


Hope this is useful to other folks.  Do with this code whatever you
wish (i.e. public domain).
