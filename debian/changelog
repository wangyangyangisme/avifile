  * debian/rules now works on Debian Potato - though some plugin packages
    will have empty content - but it's surely better then nothing.
    Also it should be better for cross compilation on non i386 platforms
  * spelling fixes (Closes: 143265) I would be more then happy
    if some native English speaker would be checking my texts.
  * I'm agains any split for contrib / main part of Avifile package
    (Closes: 143356)  - Avifile win32 plugin is able to run freely available
    GPL win32 dll codecs - e.g.  XviD, Huffyuv and soon ffmpeg as well.
    It's only the question how to package such plugins - but they
    are GPL & source available - but most probably uncompilable on Linux
    (Win32 compilers are probably needed)
    I do not want to sound rude here, but avifile development takes me 99%
    of free time and I do not have more to split project into two parts,
    maintain them separately just because someone sees only the usage
    of M$ Wm8 codecs - ok quite long entry...

  * add ffmpeg - playing OpenDiv through YV12 hw acceleration
  * I believe recompilation fixes (Closes: 103886, 104097)
  * libarts-dev is actually not a depedency problem of avifile
    but rather libsdl1.2-dev itself as this is the library which
    actually needs libarts (Closes: 104027, 104028, 103072)
    but its not a problem add this dependency for some time

avifile (0.6.0.20010614-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * (Closes: #97198) - currently the mp3 encoder is not builded
    (which effectivly ruins the usage of qtrecompress - well
     I've not inveted stupid american law..)
  * as usually 100% better playing...
  * supporting more formats (uncompressed YUY2, YV12)
  * kv4lsetup is now suid (Closes: #99057)
  * using Qt3 libraries - for they they are not fully integrated
    so some unmet dependecies are overridden
    assume this will require recompilation when everything will be
    cleaned
