    User can reserve big chunk of memory by calling VirtualAlloc with flag RESERVE
and later calls to VirtualAlloc specifying parts of this region are guaranteed to 
succeed. This doesn't perfectly fit into mmap() implementation of VirtualAlloc. 
Current implementation loses memory allocated this way.

lib/loader/externals.c:699

MultiByteToWideChar Win32 call is unsupported.

lib/loader/externals.c:289

bManualReset flag for CreateEventA Win32 call is unsupported.

lib/loader/externals.c:341

WaitForSingleObject Win32 call may be implemented incorrectly.

It is not known exactly which FOURCC's should be decoded by 'old' MPEG-4 dll.

lib/loader/externals.c:727

Win32 semaphores are supported incorrectly. Do not try to use VideoDecoder objects
 in different threads simultaneously.

lib/aviplay/audio.cpp:206

I don't know how to determine delay between write() and actual sound output for ESD
 0.2.8 ( 0.2.15 does not work for me ).

lib/avifile/AviRead.cpp:128

No AVI frame flags other than KEYFRAME are supported because of limited VirtualDub read
handler structure. 

lib/avifile/AviRead.cpp:263

AviReadStream::SetOutputFormat() is not implemented.

lib/avifile/AviWrite.cpp:83

AVI writer copies some values in main AVI header from corresponding fiels in 1st
video stream header. I don't know what should I put there if there are no video
streams at all.

lib/audiodecoder/adpcm/adpcm.cpp:23

IMA ADPCM audio decoder was only tested with one stereo file.

lib/avifile/AVIReadHandler2.cpp:382

AviReadHandler2::Header() is not implemented. AviReadFile::GetFileHeader() won't
work for files opened with this handler.

lib/avifile/AVIReadHandler2.cpp:1075

VirtualDub warned user about broken file here. What should I do?
