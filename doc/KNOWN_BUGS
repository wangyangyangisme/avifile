Problem with color depth detect on Riva 128 ( true color ).

Indeo Video 5.0 codec refuses to encode 32-bit data.

Player does not allow to choose non-ISO-8859-1 fonts for
subtitles. Solution: upgrade to Qt 2.2.4.

All programs crash during loading on some platforms. Can be solved
on client-side by upgrading libstdc++ library.
