     This timertable window implements a programable VCR-like mode into avicap.<br>
     <br>
     In the timertable window, you can edit/control the recordings which
avicap   will do automatically.<br>

</ul>
   
<h3><a name="start_timertable"></a>Start the timertable mode</h3>
  When you start avicap with 'avicap', the timertable window will be inactive.<br>
  To use the timertable, you have to click on 'Timertable' in the menu.<br>
  After you've started the timertable, it will remain active, even if you 
close the timertable window.<br>
  <br>
     At first startup, you'll see an empty table at the top of the window,
 below  you'll find buttons labeled 'new', 'modify' and 'remove'<br>
     <br>
     'new' will create a new entry in the timertable and show the editing 
controls.<br>
     <br>
   
<h3><a name="editing_controls"></a>Editing Controls</h3>
  With the editing controls, you can set:         
<ul>
       
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>When to record (only once or every day/weekday)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Date and Time when to start the recording</li>
       <li>the Time when to end the recording</li>
       <li>the channel used for recording</li>
       <li>the filename to save your recording into</li>
       <li>a description of your recording</li>
         
</ul>
If you set the 'when' combobox to 'every', you can select in the 'day' combobox
which days (every day or every weekday) - the date is ignored with 'every'<br>
<br>
If you select 'once', you have to enter the correct date.<br>
<br>
At present, it is not possible to select a different codec for each recording, 
  they all use the codec specified in the avicap configuration.<br>
     I hope I can change that in the future.<br>
     <br>
     When you've set the correct parameters, press the 'modify' button to 
commit   it actually in the table at the top.<br>
     Be aware that you have to click 'modify' to accept the parameters.<br>
<br>
When using 'every', the date you might have entered will be ignored, instead
the next correct date is entered in the table.<br>
<br>
If you click another table-entry instead, your modifications for the old
  will be lost.<br>
     <br>
     Press 'remove' if you want to remove an entry.<br>
     <br>
   
<h3><a name="checkboxes"></a>Enable and disable per checkboxes</h3>
  You have to activate the checkbox to the left of an entry to enable it
for   recording.<br>
     A disabled checkbox means, that this entry will not be recorded.<br>
     This is useful, for daily or weekly recording, etc<br>
     If you see that a daily recording clashes with another, you can temporarily
disable it for the next day/week, and turn it back on later.<br>
<br>
   
<h3><a name="start_timer"></a>Start the timer</h3>
  Press 'Start Timer' to start the timer in recording mode.<br>
     You cannot start the timer if there are no pending recordings.<br>
     <br>
     If there are pending recordings, the label on the button will show 'Stop 
  Timer'.<br>
     Press to stop the timer.<br>
     The timer can only be disabled in-between different recordings, but
not   while a recording is running? &lt;question: is this sane?&gt;<br>
     <br>
     If you have started a recording with 'Capture AVI' from the main menu
 directly,  this recording will be aborted if a recording programmed with
the timertable  needs to be done.<br>
     <br>
<h3><a name="sanity_check"></a>Sanity Check</h3>
Avicap will do 'Sanity Check' on your recordings.<br>
<br>
If two recordings conflict with each other, Avicap will display this conflict
in the status display.<br>
Avicap will display only the first conflict found - there may be more, be
warned!<br>
<br>
If Avicap reports a sanity check, better modify the times or disable one
of the conflicting recordings.<br>
<br>
If you don't correct these insane recording settings, Avicap will stop the
first recording brutally to start the second (conflicting) one.<br>
<br>
It's your own fault them, if you don't care about the sanity of your recordings
;-)<br>
<br>
   
<h3><a name="shutdown_mode"></a>Shutdown mode</h3>
  If you activate the 'shutdown' checkbox, your system will go to shutdown 
 after a recording has been done.<br>
     This behaviour can be disabled completely by configuring avicap to 'never 
  shut down system' in the general avicap configuration dialog.<br>
     <br>
     Avicap can also shutdown/poweroff your system after a recording and
resume/reboot   it just before the next recording, implementing a real power-saving
VCR like  mode, where your computer is off in-between recordings.<br>
     <br>
   
<h3><a name="logout"></a>Logout with Avicap</h3>
  If you want to enable this resume/shutdown, you HAVE to 'quit' per Avicaps
  shutdown routine.<br>
    Don't log out of X and shutdown the normal way anymore.<br>
    Use this way:<br>
    <br>
    1. Edit the timertable settings for the next recording, and start the 
timer.<br>
    2. As long as you want to work with your computer, leave Avicap in background
  running.<br>
    3. If you want to power-off your computer (maybe because you've got to
 go  to bed after a long programming session, just like me right now ;-)),
 close  all other applications, get Avicap in the foreground, and set the
'shutdown'  checkbox.<br>
    4. If your recording is more than &lt;boottime&gt;+&lt;gracetime&gt;
in  the future, Avicap will pop a requester telling you that it will shut
down,  counting down.<br>
    Ignore it.<br>
    5. After some time, Avicap will set the nvram and call the shutdown-script<br>
    6. Your system will be sent into shutdown<br>
    7. It will re-boot again<br>
    8. And get's powered down soon after booting<br>
    9. and then, some time, the RTC alarm will power-on again and your system
  will reboot, starting X and avicap in timermode, waiting for your recording<br>

<h3><a name="my_way"></a>How I use the timertable along with the shutdown
 &amp; resume mode</h3>
  I've programmed my timertable for the next two weeks with all the stuff 
I  wanna see, Avicap will be running on my computer in background while I 
am  working with it, and when I do a power-off I am sure that Avicap will 
power-on  itself when it feels the need to watch TV itself ;-)<br>
   <br>
   It's like sort of an external brain, I don't have to think about TV for
 the next two weeks, cause Avicap will do that for me if I am awake or asleep 
 :-)))<br>
   <br>
  &lt;Humor&gt;<br>
    And if I don't have time to watch the session that Avicap has recorded,
 why worry?<br>
  Avicap has watched it, so why should I watch it again?<br>
  I think it is just neccessary that anyone watches TV, and it's probably 
also a good education for my computer if he can watch TV for himself ;-))))<br>
  &lt;/Humor&gt;<br>
