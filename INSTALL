To build 'avifile' project

If you are using CVS (i.e. you have checked out project from avifile CVS
repository from sourceforge.net) there IS NO configure script present.
That means you have to create one for yourself. This can be
accomplished with execution of shell script:

   autogen.sh

in the CVS main directory. Be aware that you need relatively well configured
system to be able to use this script. Note if you believe your system
is properly configured and avifile's autogen.sh script doesn't create
usable 'configure' script - please contact avifile maintainer -
we will ask you for more details and we try to resolve your problem
(we know there are always some - but we could resolve them only with
your help) You may try to use CVS snapshot available in download section
on avifile.sourceforge.net which contains valid configure script.

now if you have valid configure script or you have downloaded 
the .tgz CVS snapshot you should run script:

   configure

Note: you may use some extra options - check  'configure --help'
to list them all

after successful configuration (i.e. there are no error/fatal messages)
just compile and install avifile project with this command

   make -j 2 install

if there is still a problem - please report it - otherwise it
will not be fixed as your problem is for 90% specific to your
system - so never expect it will resolve itself.
